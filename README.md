## Usage

## Output

Output is created in the given `model_path` in the form of an `.h5` file for the model and next to it a `.json` file for some parameters of the model.

Additionally, the method internally creates a folder under the `folder` parameter. This will default to `MY_WORKSPACE_DIR / "output_files"`.
This only contains some intermediate models and some the model parameters again. The content of this folder is not relevant to us.
